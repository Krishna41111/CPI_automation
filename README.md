# üöÄ Multi-Emulator Runner for Android AVDs  

This Python script automates running multiple Android emulators in parallel with controlled concurrency. It handles cloning base AVDs, boot checks, port allocation, CPI link automation, APK installation, and app launching ‚Äî all with logging and runtime control.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Automatic **AVD cloning** (from a base emulator).  
- Run multiple emulators with **concurrency limits**.  
- **Port management** to avoid conflicts.  
- Waits until emulator is fully **booted & ready**.  
- Automates **CPI link open ‚Üí APK install ‚Üí app launch**.  
- Saves emulator logs in `./emulator_logs/`.  
- Option to **keep emulators running** or kill them after tasks.
